/**
 * A read-only view of an underlying DataTable. A DataView allows selection of only a subset of the columns and/or rows.
 * It also allows reordering columns/rows, and duplicating columns/rows.<br>
 * 
 * A view is a live window on the underlying DataTable, not a static snapshot of data. However, you still should must be
 * careful when changing the structure of the table itself, as described here:<br>
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>Adding or removing columns from the underlying table will not be reflected by the view, and might cause
 * unexpected behavior in the view; you will have to create a new DataView from the DataTable to pick up these changes.</li>
 * <li>Adding or removing rows from the underlying table is safe and changes will be propagated to the view immediately
 * (but you must call draw() on any visualizations after this change to have the new row set rendered). Note that if
 * your view has filtered out rows by calling one of the setRows() or hideRows() methods, and you add or remove rows
 * from the underlying table, the behavior is unexpected; you must create a new DataView to reflect the new table.</li>
 * <li>Changing cell values in existing cells is safe, and changes are immediately propagated to the DataView (but you
 * must call draw() on any visualizations after this change to have the new cell values rendered).</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * It is also possible to create a DataView from another DataView. Note that whenever an underlying table or view is
 * mentioned, it refers to the level immediately below this level. In other words, it refers to the data object used to
 * construct this DataView.<br>
 * 
 * DataView also supports calculated columns; these are columns whose value is calculated on the fly using a function
 * that you supply. So, for example, you can include a column that is a sum of two preceding columns, or a column that
 * calculates and shows the calendar quarter of a date from another column. See setColumns() for more details.<br>
 * 
 * When you modify a DataView by hiding or showing rows or columns, the visualization will not be affected until you
 * call draw() on the visualization again.<br>
 * 
 * @see <a href="http://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/reference.html#DataView">DataView API Reference</a>
